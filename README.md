# easy-sgr-doc

Copy of [easy-sgr] docs. This is just an HTML markup of the README docs,
made mostly for learning html &amp; css.

Based off of:

- [easy-sgr]
- [this project](https://codepen.io/vinay-khatri/pen/bGKdBXx)

Made with vanilla HTML &amp; CSS, using [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for code coloring and
[actix](https://actix.rs/) for the backend.
